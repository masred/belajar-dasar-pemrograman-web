          <p>“Hey Harry,</p>
          <p>
            Gridlock here. Ash was busy, so she asked me to update you on
            specialist Santiago “Flores” Lucero’s progress. She must’ve noticed
            that we often have lunch together, along with Dokkaebi. What can I
            say? He loves tech and mechanics, so the three of us have a lot in
            common.
          </p>

          <p>
            He’s excited about the resources we offer, and he spends a good bit
            of time up in Mira’s business. I doubt she appreciates having him
            looking over her shoulder, but with time she’ll realize he can be an
            asset for her. He’s always made his own tools and weapons, and he’s
            got a different perspective from hers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Flores doesn’t talk much about growing up in Buenos Aires, but he
            has heaps to say about the crime lords he used to steal from, both
            there and in Los Angeles. They’re grand tales of heroism, and I’m
            inclined to believe them. Ash made it very clear that he’s not just
            a master thief, but a professional with convictions. I doubt she
            would have helped him get out of Argentina if she didn’t respect
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, I’d say he’s a good mate. A bit awkward, but he listens
            when others speak, which is more than I can say for a lot of people.
            Every night he calls home to talk to his husband, but he’s very
            private about their relationship (with me at least). He cares about
            people in general, but his marriage is on another level. Even when
            he takes off his ring, it never leaves his person.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m glad Ash got him on board. I’m sure she had her own reasons, but
            I don’t think that matters in the grand scheme of things. What does
            matter is the expertise Flores brings, his perspective, and the
            shiny little explosive invention he brought along. I’m excited to
            see him in action, I have a feeling a lot of people will be
            surprised.
